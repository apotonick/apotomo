h2. 1.1

h3. Changes
  * Widgets now reside in @app/widgets/@ and have the @Widget@ appendix per convention, identical to cells and controllers. This introduces the following changes, illustrated with an imaginary @CommentsWidget@:
  ** @widget(:comments, ...)@ will search and instantiate @CommentsWidget@ (note the missing "Widget").
  ** The @CommentsWidget@ views are searched in @app/widgets/comments/@ (note the missing "_widget").
  * Including Apotomo::Rails::ControllerMethods by hand is optional. The first call to Controller.has_widgets will include the real module.
  * You can now @#render_widget@ in your widget views to render children.
  * @#widget@ now accepts one arg only (the widget prefix). @widget(:comments)@ sets id to @:comments@.
  * #invoke now requires a state name.
  * The event is no longer added to #options at triggering time.
  * Options passed in #render_widget are no longer merged with #options. They are passed as state-args to reduce complexity.
  * We no longer have @opts and @params but #options and #params from Cell::Base.
  * The params hash is appended to the event in RequestProcessor#process_for. You can now live completely without accessing the global #params.
  * Event delegates #[] to #data.

h3. Removals
  * Removed #param, it is simply too complex.
  * Removed render :render_children and :invoke options. Use #render_widget in your state/view.
  * Removed #jump_to_state and #last_state.
  * Removed `@cell`, now longer available in state views.
  * Removed #cell, #container and #section widget shortcuts.
  * Removed @rendered_children@ local in views. Use #render_widget.
  * Removed ContainerWidget, nobody needs it.
  
h3. Bugfixes
  * Widget.responds_to_event no longer shares its options with multiple widget instances of the same class.


h2. 1.0.4

h3. Bugfixes
    * Caching states works, again. Thanks to Gudleik Rasch for spotting.
    * We cleanly require cells-3.4.x now. Thanks to Ryan Bates who remarked that Apotomo 1.0.x tries to require cells-3.5, which was wrong.

h3. Notes

    * Removed the usage of state-args. If you want the event instance in your triggered state, use @opts[:event] or upgrade to apotomo-1.1.


h2. 1.0.3

h3. Bugfixes
  * fixed gemspec to not require useless gem dependencies.


h2. 1.0.2

h3. Changes
  * removals from ViewHelper: #trigger_event, #form_to_event and friends as they use deprecated Rails helpers.
  
h3. Bugfixes
  * Widget#fire now accepts payload data for the fired event.
  * triggered states now receive the event object if they expect one argument.
