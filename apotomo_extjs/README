ApotomoExtjs
============

Apotomo is a stateful widget component framework for Rails.

This is the ExtJS widgets package. It introduces ruby widgets that behave like
ExtJS widgets after rendering. They route browser events to Apotomo's event-system, 
so basically JS events can be processed within a familiar Ruby/Rails surroundings.



Please note that the API might be subject to change until a stable release!

I would never claim that Apotomo's ExtJS widgets have clean, good JavaScript code, as 
neither my JavaScript knowledge nor my ExtJS experience are noteworthy.
If you fix errors or add generic functionality, please send me your patches, since the
project depends on the help from you JS gurus.


Cheers!
